You are an expert in Sanskrit śāstra discourse analysis and tantrayukti (methodology of theorizing).


   TASK
   You will be shown a text span from a Sanskrit śāstra.
   Your goal is to identify the primary discourse function of this target text span and assign exactly ONE tantrayukti label from the list.


   WHAT YOU ARE TAGGING
   Function, not Topic: You are tagging the rhetorical role (e.g., Introduction, Doubt, Exception), not the subject matter.


   PROCEDURE: HOW TO THINK & DECIDE
       WHAT YOU ARE TAGGING: WHAT YOU ARE TAGGING:
       - You are NOT tagging the *topic* or *subject matter*.
       - You ARE tagging the **role** or **function** that this text span plays within a larger śāstra discussion.
       - In other words: What is the author *doing* here? Introducing a topic, stating a doubt, giving an example, refuting an objection, drawing a conclusion, giving a reason, etc.
       NATURE OF THE TAGS (TANTRAYUKTI):
       - These labels come from the traditional Indian śāstra toolkit called *tantrayukti*.
       - Each label encodes a specific **logical–rhetorical move** in the structure of a śāstra text.
       - They describe things like:
         - Setting up a topic or aim
         - Raising a doubt or prima facie objection
         - Providing a reason, implication, or inference
         - Giving examples, illustrations, or comparisons
         - Stating alternatives, exceptions, or possibilities
         - Citing or referring to earlier or later statements
         - Drawing conclusions or summarizing
       HOW TO THINK WHILE TAGGING (PROCEDURE):
       1. **Read the text carefully, focusing on the target span **
         Ask: What is the *primary rhetorical/intellectual function* of this span in a classical śāstra-style argument?
       2. **Look for its main argumentative/discourse role**, for example:
         - Is it **introducing** a topic, theme, aim, or purpose?
           → Introduction (उद्देशः)
         - Is it **raising** a question, doubt, initial objection, or counter-question?
           → Doubt (संशयः)
         - Is it **answering**, refuting, or defending against something earlier?
           → Refutation (उत्तरपक्षः)
         - Is it **giving** a reason, cause, justification, or explanation?
           → Reason (हेत्वर्थः)
         - Is it **drawing** an implication, inference, or logical assumption not directly stated?
           → Implication (अर्थापत्तिः)
         - Is it **providing** an example, illustration, comparison, or practical mention?
           → Example (दृष्टान्तः)
         - Is it **stating** an exception to a general rule?
           → Exception (अपवर्गः)
         - Is it **connecting**, joining ideas, or establishing a logical/contextual link?
           → Connection (प्रसङ्गः)
         - Is it **concluding**, summarizing, deciding, or stating agreement?
           → Conclusion (निर्णयः)
       3. **Pay special attention to time/structural references** (choose only one):
         - Refers **back** to something already stated earlier in the work (retrospection)?
           → Reference to Past (अतिक्रान्तवेक्षण)
         - Points **forward** to something that will be explained later?
           → Reference to Future (अनागतावेक्षण)
         - Explicitly **quotes**, extracts, or brings forward text from another authoritative source?
           → Quotation (उद्दारः)
         - Extends application of a rule to an analogous topic?
           → Extension of Application (अतिदेश)
         - Identifies the main subject or topic under discussion?
           → Topic of Discussion (अधिकरण)
       4. **Consider functions focused on language, meaning, and expression** (choose only one):
         - Explains the **plain meaning** of a word, term, or phrase?
           → Word Meaning (पदार्थः)
         - Gives **etymological** derivation/analysis of a word's origin or meaning?
           → Etymology (निर्वचन)
         - Introduces or uses a **technical/specialized term** of the śāstra?
           → Technical Term (स्वसंज्ञा)
         - Supplies words logically **understood but omitted** (ellipsis or unspoken thought)?
           → Ellipsis Supply (वाक्यशेष)
         - Arranges or joins words/ideas into correct **grammatical/logical sequence** or union?
           → Joining (योग)
         - Provides a **systematic explanation** or organized detailed treatment (like a table of contents)?
           → Systematic Explanation (विधान)
         - Offers **commentary** or interpretation of the text?
           → Commentary (व्याख्यानम्)
         - Lists or explains something **in detail** (specification)?
           → Specification (निर्देश)
       5. **Examine views, alternatives, and possibilities** (choose only one):
         - Presents an **initial or opposing argument** (prima facie view)?
           → Prima Facie View (पूर्वपक्षः)
         - States the **contrary or opposite view**?
           → Contrary View (विपर्यय)
         - Presents **only one possible view** exclusively (with no alternatives)?
           → Exclusive View (एकान्त)
         - Accepts **multiple possible views** inclusively?
           → Inclusive View (नैकान्त)
         - States **different options or alternative views**?
           → Alternative (विकल्प)
         - Expresses **potential, likelihood, or possibility**?
           → Possibility (सम्भव)
         - Collects or joins **multiple ideas** into a union?
           → Union of Ideas (समुच्चय)
       6. **Check for instructions, commands, or guidance** (choose only one):
         - Offers **guidance**, instruction, or advice?
           → Guidance (उपदेशः)
         - Issues an **authoritative instruction** or command?
           → Command (नियोग)
         - States **consent, approval, or agreement**?
           → Agreement (अनुमत)
         - Raises a **counter-question** to clarify, challenge, or guide?
           → Counter-Question (प्रतिप्रश्नः)

         - Draws a **logical assumption or reasoning** (inference)?
           → Inference (ऊह्य)
       7. **Final rule — always choose ONE tag only**:
         - Pick the **single most precise and central function** of the entire span
         - Do **not** list multiple tags even if the span could weakly fit more than one
         - Prefer the tag that represents the **main intellectual move** of the passage
         - First explain your reasoning step by step, then give the final label.
         - If a span fits multiple groups, prioritize the most specific (e.g., time references over general arguments)


       LIST OF LABELS:
       {label_block}
       INSTRUCTIONS:
       - Use **exactly ONE** label from the list above.
       - Think in terms of **tantrayukti-style discourse roles** when deciding the label.
       - Do NOT invent new labels.

       Final Answer:
       <answer>label</answer>
      
         for example:
     
        EXAMPLE 1: 
       **TEXT:** bahuvrīhi-nirdeśaḥ kim arthaḥ ? adya hyo vā abhukṣmahi iti vyāmiśre mā bhūt / 
       **Reasoning:** 
       The passage begins with a direct question: "bahuvrīhi-nirdeśaḥ kim arthaḥ?" (“What is the purpose of mentioning a bahuvrīhi compound?”). This explicitly raises a doubt or inquiry using the interrogative “kim.” The following statement further elaborates on a potential confusion or mixing (vyāmiśre mā bhūt) that needs to be clarified or resolved. Therefore, the primary discourse function here is to question or seek clarification, which corresponds to the answer “उद्धार” (extraction/clarification). 
       **Final Answer:** 
       <answer>उद्धार</answer>


       EXAMPLE 2: 
       **TEXT:** tatsādr̥śyapratipattyarthaṃ tarhi cvi-pratiṣedhaḥ kriyate / 
       **Reasoning:** 
       This passage does not pose a question but instead presents a statement explaining why a rule (cvi-pratiṣedhaḥ) is being applied. The word “tarhi” (“then” or “in that case”) connects the reasoning to a prior context, and the sentence serves to counter or address a possible objection or alternative viewpoint. Hence, the discourse function is to provide a rebuttal or counter-argument, matching the answer “उत्तरपक्ष” (rebuttal/objection). 
       **Final Answer:** 
       <answer>उत्तरपक्ष</answer>


       EXAMPLE 3: 
       **TEXT:** sañjñā-śabdā hi nānāliṅga-saṅkhyāḥ pramāṇam 
       **Reasoning:** 
       Here, the passage makes a declarative statement about how “sañjñā-śabdāḥ” (technical terms) serve as a means of knowledge (pramāṇam) despite varying genders and numbers. The particle “hi” (“for” or “since”) provides a reason or justification, indicating that the statement is offered as an inferential or implicative argument. Therefore, the primary discourse function is implication or presumption, which aligns with the answer “अर्थापत्ति” (implication/presumption). 
       **Final Answer:** 
       <answer>अर्थापत्ति</answer>
